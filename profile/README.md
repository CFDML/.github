## 🌊🙋‍♀️ What is CFDML?

**CFDML (Cross-disciplinary Fluid Dynamics and Machine Learning)** is an open, collaborative alliance of scientists and engineers (from CAS, USTC, PKU, etc.), dedicated to advancing research, software, and tools at the convergence of **Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. Our mission is to support, develop, and share open-source solutions that enable next-generation fluid dynamic modeling and simulation.

**Our core focus includes:**

- ⚙️ **Efficient CFD solvers and infrastructures** integrating data-driven methods  
- 🔬 **Physics-informed ML models** for multi-scale and multi-physics flows  
- 📊 **Benchmarks and datasets** for evaluating unified CFDML approaches  
- 📚 **Educational resources, lectures, and tutorials** for community learning
